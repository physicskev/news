**Title:** Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)  
**URL:** https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm/  
**Summary:** Quantum mechanics is, at least at first glance and at least in part, a mathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopic particles — or, at least, of the measuring instruments we use to explore those behaviors — and in that capacity, it is spectacularly successful: in terms of power and precision, head and shoulders above any theory we have ever had. Mathematically, the ...
